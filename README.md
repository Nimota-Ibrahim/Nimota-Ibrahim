# Nimota Ibrahim 
### Data Lead | Analytics & Governance Projects

I design and implement robust data pipelines that transform complex datasets into actionable insights for decision-making.

I work across the **full data lifecycle**, including:

* Data collection and cleaning

* Statistical validation and exploratory analysis

* Feature engineering and model development

* Translating model outputs into business-relevant decisions

My projects combine **predictive modelling, interpretable analytics, and practical deployment**, demonstrating how data can support real-world decision-making and strategy.


### Technical Stack

**Programming & Data:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), SQL (PostgreSQL)<br>
**Visualization & BI:** Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn<br>
**Environment & Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git/GitHub, Excel<br>
**Core Practices:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Statistical Validation, Reproducible Pipelines, Decision Logic Design<br>


### Featured Project: 

#### [House Price Intelligence Pipeline](https://github.com/Nimota-Ibrahim/House-Price-Prediction-Feature-Engineering/blob/main/README.md)


**Objective:** Build a regression-based valuation engine with an integrated "Sanity-Check" layer for pricing audits.

* **The Methodology:** Developed a leakage-safe pipeline to estimate residential property values, achieving a **MAPE of 8.75%**.
  
* **The Decision Logic:** Created a custom validation function that flags properties where listed prices deviate by **>15%** from model estimates.

* **Output:** Automatically categorizes listings as **"Underpriced"**, **"Overpriced"**, or **"Validated"** to prioritize manual audits.

* **Impact:** Transformed a standard predictive model into a decision-support tool that identifies high-risk pricing anomalies without manual filtering.

### My Philosophy

I treat models as **components within analytical workflows**, emphasizing:<br>
#### Data -> Validation -> Feature Engineering -> Model -> Interpretation -> Business Logic

Focus is not only on predictive accuracy, but also **robustness and actionable insights**.
