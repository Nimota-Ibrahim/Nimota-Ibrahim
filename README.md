# Nimota Ibrahim | Data Science & Analytics

**Building reliable analytical pipelines that translate complex data into decision-support signals.**

I specialize in the full lifecycle of data products; from rigorous cleaning and statistical validation to designing the business logic that turns model outputs into actionable insights.


### Technical Stack

**Programming & Data:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), SQL (PostgreSQL)<br>
**Visualization & BI:** Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn<br>
**Environment & Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git/GitHub, Excel<br>
**Core Practices:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Statistical Validation, Reproducible Pipelines, Decision Logic Design<br>


### Featured Project: 

#### [House Price Intelligence Pipeline](https://github.com/NimotaPro/House-Price-Intelligence-Pipeline/blob/main/README.md)


**Objective:** Build a regression-based valuation engine with an integrated "Sanity-Check" layer for pricing audits.

* **The Methodology:** Developed a leakage-safe pipeline to estimate residential property values, achieving a **MAPE of 8.75%**.
  
* **The Decision Logic:** Created a custom validation function that flags properties where listed prices deviate by **>15%** from model estimates.

* **Output:** Automatically categorizes listings as **"Underpriced"**, **"Overpriced"**, or **"Validated"** to prioritize manual audits.

* **Impact:** Transformed a standard predictive model into a decision-support tool that identifies high-risk pricing anomalies without manual filtering.

### My Philosophy

I treat models as **components within analytical workflows**, emphasizing:
Data -> Validation -> Feature Engineering -> Model -> Interpretation -> Business Logic

Focus is not only on predictive accuracy, but also **robustness and actionable insights**.
